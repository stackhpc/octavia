    Add the vip_sg_ids parameter to the Amphora driver, a list of Neutron
    Security Groups. When set, the Amphora driver applies the Security Groups to
    the VIP port of the Load Balancer. It also doesn't set any Security Group
    Rules related to the Listeners on this ports, however it adds Security
    Groups Rules for VRRP and haproxy peers when needed.
    This feature does not work with SR-IOV ports as Neutron does not support
    Security Groups on these ports.
