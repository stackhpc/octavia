    Fixed a bug with the `nopreempt` option in keepalived. The option didn't
    work properly because the default role of the `MASTER` amphora was set.
    Removing the default roles from the configuration files fixed that issue.
    Now after a failover, the newly created amphora doesn't preempt the
    `MASTER` role from the other amphora.
