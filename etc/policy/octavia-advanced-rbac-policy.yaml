# This policy YAML file implements the "Advanced RBAC" rules for Octavia that
# were introduced in the Pike release of the Octavia API.
#
# These rules require users to have a load-balancer_* role to be able to access
# the Octavia v2 API.
#
# This is stricter than the "Keystone Default Roles" implemented in the code
# as part of the "Consistent and Secure Default RBAC" OpenStack community goal.

# The default is to not allow access unless the auth_strategy is 'noauth'.
# Users must be a member of one of the following roles to have access to
# the load-balancer API:
#
# role:load-balancer_observer
#     User has access to load-balancer read-only APIs
# role:load-balancer_global_observer
#     User has access to load-balancer read-only APIs including resources
#     owned by others.
# role:load-balancer_member
#     User has access to load-balancer read and write APIs
# role:load-balancer_admin
#     User is considered an admin for all load-balnacer APIs including
#     resources owned by others.
# role:admin
#     User is admin to all APIs

                     role:load-balancer_admin"

# API access roles

"load-balancer:owner": "project_id:%(project_id)s"

# Note: 'is_admin:True' is a policy rule that takes into account the
# auth_strategy == noauth configuration setting.
# It is equivalent to 'rule:context_is_admin or {auth_strategy == noauth}'
